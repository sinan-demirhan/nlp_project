## Brief Description:
The NLP group project aimed to develop a text classification system for tweet sentiment analysis. Weâ€™ve experimented with various techniques, including different classic ML algorithms, different neural network architectures, and fine-tuning strategies for the language model as described in the project description document. We performed extensive analysis and conducted thorough evaluations to identify the best-performing model as shown by the results. In a nutshell, the NLP group project involved data scraping/collection, implementing, and comparing different approaches for twitter sentiment analysis.
